/**
 * One online player, as a plugin sees it.
 *
 * <p>A <b>live handle</b> on a connected client, the same way {@link ForbricBlock} is one on a corner: identity
 * is the account, not the wrapper. Bukkit's contract says a {@code Player} reflects the connection as it is now,
 * so this class holds the {@code ServerPlayer} and asks it every time. Two wrappers for one account are equal
 * and hash alike, which is what lets a plugin compare a player from an event with one from the server.
 *
 * <p><b>An account has three names and they are not interchangeable.</b> The game profile's name is the account
 * name a player logs in with; the scoreboard name is what team prefixes decorate; and the display name is what
 * chat shows, which a plugin may set. Bukkit keeps all three, and so does this. The profile name is the one to
 * key a map by, because the other two are presentation and change.
 *
 * <p><b>Identity is the UUID.</b> A name can be changed, and on an offline-mode server can be claimed by anyone,
 * so {@link #getUniqueId()} is the only stable key. The name is offered for display and for the common case; a
 * plugin that stores anything should store the UUID.
