/**
 * Brings up the Bukkit/Paper plugin bridge.
 *
 * <p>The bridge's own classes ({@code org.cn.xiaofan.bukkit.*}) are compiled INTO this kernel: they live in the
 * {@code runtime} source set, ride inside {@code forbric-kernel-runtime.jar}, and are defined by
 * {@link net.forbric.kernel.classloading.ForbricClassLoader} like every other game-side class. So there is no bridge
 * jar to locate, deploy or version-match — a kernel that boots at all has its bridge.
 *
 * <p>This class is nonetheless the BOOT side of the seam, and names no {@code org.bukkit} or {@code net.minecraft}
 * type: it reaches the bridge by string and reflection the way {@code KernelRuntimeClasses} reaches the kernel's own
 * game half. That is not ceremony — the boot jar is parent-loaded and must stay loadable with no game on the
 * classpath, and a direct reference to {@code org.bukkit.*} here would break exactly that.
 *
 * <h2>Why the API jar is downloaded rather than shipped</h2>
 *
 * <p>The bridge needs Paper's API ({@code org.bukkit.*}) and the adventure component library its signatures name.
 * Both carry no Minecraft code, so they could legally be bundled — but bundling them would add several megabytes
 * to every Forbric download, re-upload someone else's artifact, and (for some of them) change this distribution's
 * licence surface for every user who never loads a plugin. Instead they are fetched once into
 * {@code <gameDir>/.forbric-kernel/bukkit-libs/} and reused, which is also how the installer treats the game's own
 * artifacts. This is the same rule the transfer component follows for Fabric API and Team Reborn Energy: compiled
 * against, never shipped.
 *
 * <p>The libraries are added to the loader as owned jars, which is also where the bridge already is. They are
 * game-owned (see {@code DelegationPolicy}) because Paper's API resolves its implementations through
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}, which searches the interface's own class loader — and those implementations
 * call into {@code net.minecraft.*}.
