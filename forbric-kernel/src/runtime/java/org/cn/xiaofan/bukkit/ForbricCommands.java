/**
 * Where a plugin's Brigadier commands go.
 *
 * <p><b>The whole job is one translation.</b> A plugin builds a command tree out of Paper's
 * {@code CommandSourceStack}, and the game's dispatcher holds trees of its own
 * {@code net.minecraft.commands.CommandSourceStack}. The two are different types, so a node cannot simply be
 * added — every node, its executor, its requirement and its suggestion provider have to be re-expressed in the
 * game's type. That is what this class does, once per registered command.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a copy and not a cast.</b> Brigadier nodes are generic in the source type but the generics are
 * erased, so a cast would compile. It would also be wrong in the only way that matters: the executor inside the
 * node receives whatever the dispatcher passes it, and the game passes ITS source. A cast-compiled tree would
 * run a plugin's executor with a source object the plugin's own code cannot use, failing at the first
 * {@code getSender()} — long after the command appeared to register.
 *
 * <p><b>The executor is wrapped, the arguments are not.</b> A node's {@code executes} callback takes the source,
 * so it is wrapped: the game's source is turned into this bridge's {@code CommandSourceStack} before the plugin
 * sees it. An argument's type, by contrast, is a plain Brigadier {@code ArgumentType} that Paper builds on top
 * of the game's own — {@code ArgumentTypes.players()} wraps {@code EntityArgument.players()} — so it is carried
 * across unchanged and resolves against the game's source exactly as it does on a real server.

     * Registers a {@code BasicCommand} — the form that parses its own arguments.
     *
     * <h2>Where the arguments come from</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@code BasicCommand} is the old Bukkit shape: the command receives the words after its label as a
     * {@code String[]} and decides what they mean itself. Brigadier does not work that way — it has already
     * parsed the line into a tree by the time an executor runs, and a literal node by itself matches nothing
     * after the label.
     *
     * <p>So the node is a literal with one {@code greedyString} child, and the executor reads the rest of the
     * line off the {@code StringReader} rather than the parsed argument. A greedy argument is the only one that
     * does not impose a grammar: it matches every remaining character including spaces, which is exactly what a
     * command that splits its own arguments needs. Reading the reader instead of the argument is what keeps the
     * quoting intact — {@code /kit give "my kit" Steve} must reach the plugin as two words, and a
     * {@code split(" ")} over the parsed value would produce three.
     *
     * <p><b>This used to pass {@code new String[0]}.</b> Every {@code BasicCommand} therefore ran with no
     * arguments at all, whatever was typed — {@code /mycmd give stone} reached the plugin as an empty array. The
     * class comment claimed a redirect captured the remainder and had done so since it was written; no redirect
     * was ever added, and nothing noticed because a command that ignores its arguments works either way.
     *
     * <h2>Why a child node and not the executor alone</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because the label must work with and without arguments. The executor on the literal handles
     * {@code /mycmd}; the greedy child handles {@code /mycmd anything at all}. A single node cannot do both —
     * Brigadier dispatches on what it has parsed, and a literal with a child is not runnable unless the line
     * ends at it.
