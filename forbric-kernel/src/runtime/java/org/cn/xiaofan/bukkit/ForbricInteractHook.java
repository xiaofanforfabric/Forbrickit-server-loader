/*
 * Forbric Bukkit bridge — the seam the game's own interaction methods call.
 *
 * This class names NO Bukkit type. That is the point of it being separate from
 * {@link ForbricInteractDispatch}: the kernel injects a call to these methods into
 * {@code ServerPlayerGameMode.useItemOn/useItem/handleBlockBreakAction} and
 * {@code ServerGamePacketListenerImpl.handleAnimate}, and those call sites are reached on a server that
 * may have no Paper API on its classpath at all (the bridge is optional and its API jars are fetched,
 * not shipped). Linking THIS class therefore costs only game types; the class that does name
 * {@code org.bukkit.*} is instantiated when — and only when — the bridge actually starts.
 *
 * <p>A sink that is not installed answers "the game proceeds exactly as it was": every method here
 * returns null (the caller's own answer, meaning no Bukkit decision) or false.
