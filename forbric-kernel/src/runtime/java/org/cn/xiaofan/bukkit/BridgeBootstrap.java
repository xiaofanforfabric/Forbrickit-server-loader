/**
 * Finds the plugin jars in a directory, loads them, and enables them in order.

 * <p>This is the bridge's whole job, and deliberately the smallest version of it that can be observed working:
 * discover, load, enable. There is no dependency sorting, no {@code PluginManager} registry, no reload. Each of
 * those is a real thing a server does, and each is added once something needs it rather than guessed at now.
 *
 * <h2>What "enabled" means here</h2>
 *
 * <p>For each jar: read its {@code plugin.yml}, define its main class in a {@link PluginClassLoader}, construct
 * it (which links it to its loader through {@code JavaPlugin}'s own guard), call {@code init(...)} to fill the
 * fields its accessors read, then {@code onLoad()} and {@code setEnabled(true)} — which is what runs
 * {@code onEnable()}.
 *
 * <p>A plugin that fails to load is reported and skipped; one bad jar must not stop the others, which is the
 * same rule every loader in this project follows.
