/**
 * Fetches the Paper API and the adventure libraries its signatures name, once, into a cache under the game
 * directory.
 *
 * <p>Boot-side and dependency-free ({@code java.net.http} only). It runs before the class loader exists, because
 * the jars it returns are owned jars.
 *
 * <h2>Only what the game does not already have</h2>
 *
 * <p>The API also needs gson, guava, joml, snakeyaml, log4j, slf4j, fastutil and brigadier — all of which
 * Minecraft 26.2 ships, and which the kernel already puts on the owned classpath ahead of any guest jar. Fetching
 * a second copy would put two versions of one library on a single loader, where resolution goes by whichever URL
 * comes first; that is the same failure the kernel's library ordering exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p>The version is pinned rather than resolved. {@code 26.2.build.+} would work and would also silently move the
 * API out from under the generated {@code Server} stub, which is written against one specific version.
